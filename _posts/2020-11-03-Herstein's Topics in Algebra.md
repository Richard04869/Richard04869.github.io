Herstein's Topics in Algebra is one of the well known abstract algebra text. It is super-clear in its writing style with its theorems introduced with enthusiastic motivations. Not too wordy, but not so compact that it misses important details. Although it is not an easy read, but any undergraduate drilling in math(or even beginning graduates) will definitely benefit himslef/herself by learning from this book. I bet that most of the modern-day abstract algebra books, such ones like Fraleigh's "First Course in Abstract Algebra" and Dummit & Foote's "Abstract Algebra" must have been influenced by this Herstein's masterpiece. 

The exercise problems from Herstein's book are also interesting and motivating at the same time. But a few problems lying is, there are some exercises(particularly, the ones with asterisks) which cannot be handled smoothly without introducing some other concepts explicitly. So I have decided to give a challenge of making a complete solution mannual for the exercises in the Herstein's book. Since I am just an undergradute, there must be few more better ways of solving the exercise problems. I will readily post a pdf for each sections at least once in a week. 

Here are some of the notes regarding my mathematical writing style:

1. I have tried to follow the Herstein's method of notation. For an example, $o(G)$ for the order of a group $G$. Also, I kept using myself with left multiplication for automorphism, that is, for an automorphism $T : G \to G $, $xT$ shall denote the mapped element.

2. Although Herstein did not explicitly introduced the notion of "Group action", I shall make use of it unless there is a confusion or mis-interpretation in the contexts.

3. I am also a beginner in mathematics and especially in abstract algebra. There will be many mistakes and missing details. I appreciate any type of comments regarding my proofs and solutions. Valid criticisms are always welcome!
