1. This is a direct imitation of the website lovekrand.github.io. I am uploading my solutions for homework problems that have appeared in Howie's Fields and Galois Theory for reviewing purposes.

2. I am a beginner in mathematics, especially in abstract algebra. There may be mistakes and missing details. I appreciate any comments regarding my proofs and writings. Insightful criticisms are always welcome!

Remark: Not every problem is solved on my own. References include sources such as Stack Exchange and the answer key at the end of the textbook.

I will readily post a PDF containing more than one section, mainly once a week because homework is due once per week.
